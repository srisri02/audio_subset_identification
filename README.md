# audio_subset_identification

Cloud computing has become an efective solution for various services on the inter-
net. Additionally, a cloud environment acts as a default storage location for applica-
tion users. Large cloud storage service providers receive terabytes of data per sec-
ond with an enormous amount of duplicated content. The duplicate copies can be

eliminated using the deduplication technique. The proposed research work detects
redundant audio content of the existing fles in a cloud environment. Additionally,

this study investigates the cloud computing environment which consists of numer-
ous audio fles (waveform audio fle format). The proposed work detects redundant

content and identifes only a part of the existing audio fle, which refnes the dupli-
cated content over the space. This can be accomplished using the refned super sub-
set identifcation algorithm, which processes a waveform audio fle format content

as numerical data and efciently detects the repeated contents in an elastic cloud

computing environment. The results demonstrate the accuracy of detecting dupli-
cated fles present in various fles. The visual representation of the results proves the

accuracy and exhibits that the quality of the audio content was not compromised.
Finally, the method is efectively validated in a real-time environment.
